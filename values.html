            <h4>Flavor & Aroma</h4>
            <p>
              Do you want to smell ridiculously amazing smells single every day of your life? Us too. Fresh, homegrown herbs help bring the full potential out in those dishes and drinks you work so hard to create. Enjoy impossibly fresh ingredients that blow the grocery store’s packaged crap out of the water.

            <h4>Health & Nutrition</h4>
            <p>
              We give our plants multi-vitamins. Well, sort of. Adding trace minerals into the soil provide the plants with all of the micro-nutrients they need to create a plethora of vitamins, minerals, and aromatic compounds. Super market produce does not come close in terms of nutritional density, even most of the organic stuff.

            <h4>Beauty & Serenity</h4>
            <p>
              You know the saying, "look good, feel good"? Well, that applies to your living space as well. Nature provides a getaway from the stress and anxiety that can occasionally get the best of us all. Time and time again science has shown the multitude of benefits of spending time in nature...and you don’t need to drive an hour to a mountain to get it.

            <h4>Nature & Sustainability</h4>
            <p>
              Kick back and enjoy life. The leading cause of biodiversity loss is habitat destruction and degradation. In addition to providing produce to you, our landscapes aim to create habitat and forage for birds, pollinators, and other beneficial critters. Your yard will provide a safe haven for life to flourish in areas impacted by urbanization. It will also mitigate soil loss, reduce runoff, and lower your fossil fuel footprint. And with a well designed landscape, nature does most of the gardening for you.

            <h4>Empowerment & Independence</h4>
            <p>
              We think the basic ability to provide you and your loved ones with an essential human need is a preeeetty important life skill. We’ll get back to you when we figure out how to produce air and water (right after giving our Nobel Prize acceptance speech). Let us give you a kick start on your way to more liberty and less reliance on corporations and industrialized agriculture. We encourage everyone to become a more self-sufficient member of society and this planet.
