          <p><span class="revolt">F</span>or over 10,000 years, humans have been growing their own food. Before that, our hominid ancestors foraged and harvested their entire food supply directly from nature. Over the past few decades, however, mankind has lost this intrinsic connection with our planet.</p>
          <p>Most of our sustenance comes wrapped in plastic, is shipped from hundreds (if not thousands) of miles away, and is often processed beyond recognition. The Industrial Revolution’s solution to producing food for an ever-increasing population has been the establishment of high volume, low quality industrial farms and food manufacturers. Fortunately, Big Agriculture now finds themselves fighting an uphill battle. Their practices are unsustainable for the environment. Their produce is devoid of nutrition and flavor. They rely on the wallets of taxpayers like you to heavily subsidize their poorly designed industry and they lean on corporate lobbyists to uphold their profit-minded food regulations.</p>

          <p><span class="revolt">T</span>here’s another piece to this puzzle. Over the past fifty years, our consumer society has become increasingly obsessed with maintaining wasteful lawns and yards that encourage the rampant use of fossil fuels, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers. These unnatural and often poorly designed landscapes provide little ecological or utilitarian value, and are--to put it kindly--a terribly misaligned use of society’s resources.</p>
          <p>And at what cost? The Big Business approach to landscaping and meeting society’s food demand has set us on a path towards increasingly fragile ecosystems, more reliance on fossil fuels, higher healthcare costs, and worst of all...bland food!</p>

          <p><span class="revolt">L</span>uckily, delicious food, nutrition and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. On the contrary, we’ve found that a landscape infused with a combination of fantastic flavors and aromas, jaw-dropping beauty, nutritional density, and ecological consciousness creates something very special...something we in the business like to call “really f*cking awesome”.</p>
          <p>We can work with nature instead of against it. The field of sustainable agriculture is building a head of steam, and it is literally easier than ever to create and maintain a bountiful landscape that provides its inhabitants with flavorful, gorgeous, and nutritious produce. A grassroots (har har) overhaul of our food system is rapidly building momentum and we now have the know-how to walk a more mindful path. We’re lucky to be in such an open-minded and progressive city, and couldn’t think of a better place to upset the status quo and begin creating a better planet, one inspired dish at a time.</p>
