              <p><img src="./images/raised_bed_200_283.jpg" class="left-image services-image"/>If you have an outdoor space that needs some love -- be it a yard, balcony, rooftop, or that overgrown briar patch draped in popped birthday balloons and broken dreams -- we want to help you transform it into something more beautiful and enriching.</p>
              <p>Our projects work alongside nature, using nerdy yet attractive ecological designs that enrich life. You’ll become a plant-growing badass with the help of our hands-on training sessions and the upcoming Nightshade app which will provide details on what’s growing your landscape, recipe ideas, and useful plant care tips. Most importantly, you’ll get the multitude of benefits that come alongside an attractive and practical outdoor space that enhances your culinary prowess.</p>
              <p><img src="./images/produce_200_150.jpg" class="right-image services-image"/>Not everyone will be a good fit as our client, and we’re cool with that. Our goal is to start and maintain mutually beneficial relationships with folks who have a shared passion for quality food/drink and an appreciation for our planet. You don’t need to be an seasoned gardener or landscape designer, that’s where we can help. Once we find clients that are a good match for Nightshade, we’ll work our asses off to deliver a high quality product/service and provide you with on-going support.</p>
