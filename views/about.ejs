            <h3>The Backstory</h3>
            <p>Yo! We are Bort and Caleb...and we’re excited that you’re checking out this project. At one point along this path, we were both simply concerned about getting easier access to fresh herbs to cook with. Immediately, we noticed a bump in flavor and freshness from our homegrown herbs. We also began to realize that growing your own herbs has other perks: convenience, less waste, and saving some serious dough at the grocery store (especially if you already opt for organic). </p>
            <p>We also found fulfillment in learning how to keep plants alive...err...how to cultivate our own personalized collection of fine herbs! We found a creative outlet in selecting plants that complemented our favorite cooking styles and cocktail recipes. It evokes a honest sense of pride and badassery when you walk out your back door, snip off a couple sprigs of flat-leaf parsley, and use that astounding aroma and flavor to bring out the highest potential in your own inspired culinary creation. We are home cooks, cocktail enthusiasts, native Washingtonians, and big fans of living the Good Life…join us on that journey!</p>

            <p>It started as most great adventures do - with a stiff drink. I believe it was a "South Side". See, when I set out to refine my cocktail crafting capabilities, I quickly realized two things. First, drinks made with fresh herbs are the sh*t. Second, it's expensive and super wasteful to buy those herbs at the store. The solution was obvious, and what started as a few plants on a window sill has grown into a full-fledged passion project.</p>
            <p>I love building things and I love sharing my interests with others. Be it a piece of software or a plant installation, I find immense joy in taking a concept and shaping it into a reality. I believe life is short, and it should be spent eating the best food, drinking the best drinks, and generally enjoying the best that this green earth has to offer.</p>

            <p>Cider vinegar. Molasses. Ceylon cinnamon. Ancho chiles. Flat-leaf parsley. More flat-leaf parsley. Okay, just a little more parsley… Perfect! Creating and sharing healthy and (usually) delicious food is a passion of mine. I love to explore and experience rich flavors and aromas, whether that’s coming from home-cooked meals, craft beer, or good cocktails (no offense, appletini). As is the case for cooking and mixology, I believe that balance is one of the keys to a fulfilling life.</p>
            <p>Much aligned with my musical tastes, I love to cook with complex and aggressive flavors from every corner of the globe. I assert that every dish should include a healthy pinch of cayenne… or two… preferably homegrown ;) I’m grateful to find myself tromping around wetlands and forests (and the occasional cubicle) to pay the bills. I’m a huge nature nerd and animal lover, and I strive to walk the walk when it comes to sustainable and healthy living \m/</p>
