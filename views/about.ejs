              <h3>The Backstory</h3>
              <p>Nightshade Culinary Landscapes is at the forefront of the DC-area green revolution: designing, installing, & maintaining customized gardens & edible landscapes for folks who value exceptional flavor and want to make a positive impact on the ecosystem and local economy.</p>
              <p>Our passion for urban/suburban agro-ecology is also channeled into unique culinary events and products, designed to bring awareness to and engagement with local flora & sustainable food sourcing while putting flavor and aroma at the paramount.</p>
              <p>Early on this path, we were simply concerned about improving our access to fresh herbs for cooking… so we started growing our own. Immediately, we noticed a serious jump in flavor and freshness, not to mention the unparalleled convenience that comes with having them availabe a few steps out the back door. We produced less waste, created habitat for pollinators, and found fulfillment in watching our plants flourish.</p>
              <!--p>We found a creative outlet in selecting off-the-beaten-trail flavors that complemented our favorite cooking styles and cocktail recipes. It evokes an honest sense of pride and fulfillment to snip off a couple sprigs of your own spicy orange thyme and use that astounding aroma and flavor to bring out the highest potential in your own inspired culinary creations. Sharing this joy with friends and family is what inspires us, and our goal is to bring that experience to as many DC-area cooks as we can.</p-->
              <p>We’re hardcode homecooks, cocktail enthusiasts, DC natives, and big fans of living the Good Life… join us on this journey!</p>

              <p>It started as most great adventures do -- with a stiff drink. I believe it was a “South Side,” a classic libation made with gin and fresh mint. You see, when I set out to refine my cocktail crafting skills, I quickly realized two things. First, drinks made with fresh herbs are amazing. Second, it’s expensive and wasteful to buy those herbs at the store. The solution was obvious, and what started as a few plants on a window sill has grown into a full fledged passion project. I now maintain my own sprawling rooftop oasis, which I keep stocked with as many tasty herbs and beautiful vine flowers as possible.</p>
              <p>I love building things and sharing my interests with others. Be it a piece of software or a crazy-cool plant installation, I find immense joy in taking a concept and shaping it into reality. I believe life is short, and it should be spent eating the best food, drinking the best drinks, and generally enjoying the best that this green earth has to offer.</p>

              <p>Creating and sharing nutrient-dense, neo-traditional, and (usually) delicious meals with friends, family, and my community is a deep passion of mine. Much aligned with my musical tastes, I love to cook with complex and aggressive flavor profiles from all corners of the globe. My best dishes are labors of love… and are almost always topped with few dashes of homemade hot sauce! I love to explore and experience rich flavors and aromas, whether that’s coming from home-cooked feasts or a decadent craft beer or cocktail.</p>
              <p>Studying and incorporating regenerative agriculture and organic gardening into my life has been richly rewarding and I don’t see myself turning back. I’m a professional restoration ecologist, permaculturist, and tree nerd, and I also dabble in edible & medicinal plant and mushroom foraging. My wife (Rossi) and I have an increasingly productive suburban homestead & wildlife habitat here in Northern Virginia, where we host our semi-annual Feasts.</p>
              <p>I don’t care for politics, but I do strongly believe that supporting local, values-based businesses is the only solution to shifting our globalized, profit-driven economy into something that truly supports both our planet and our people. For me, a worthy cause is sticking it to The Man and overhauling how we (humanity) feed ourselves...with no compromises on deliciousness! At essence, I’m a huge nerd and animal lover, and I strive to walk the walk when it comes to compassionate, healthy, and sustainable living \m/</p>

              <h3>Rossi</h3>
              <p>I joined Nightshade Culinary Landscapes in 2019, and share the same passion that unites our team… creating and enjoying amazing food & drink with homegrown ingredients. I have a crush on arugula and bees, and my husband and I are hosting our first 160,000 bees in two colonies this year on our suburban homestead.</p>
              <p>I work full-time in ecosystem conservation and am also passionate about improving our society’s food security. My husband and I are advancing these causes by transforming our suburban yard into an oasis of edible and ecologically beneficial plants. We use our sustainable ingredients to create wonderful dishes with tastes that would make your heart smile, accompanied with an awesome herbal cocktail that pairs perfectly in a flavor symposium... (yes.. I love poetry and adding a dash of drama – I’m a romantic Latina!). We then engage the community by hosting unique & sustainable food & drink events featuring these ingredients.</p>
              <p>In addition to hosting these food & drink events, I also capture aromas and tastes in homemade culinary products, inspired by ancestral knowledge from different cultures and our native plant species. I also create products based on herbalism principles (e.g. teas, fire ciders, tinctures, and more).</p>
