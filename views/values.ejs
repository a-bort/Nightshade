              Do you want to smell ridiculously amazing smells every single day of your life? Us too. Fresh, homegrown herbs and produce help bring out the full potential in the dishes and drinks you love to create, enjoy, and share. Savor impossibly fresh ingredients that blow the grocery store’s packaged crap out of the water.

              Buzzkill: The leading cause of biodiversity loss is habitat destruction and degradation. In addition to providing produce for you, our landscapes aim to create habitat and forage for birds, pollinators, and other beneficial critters. Your plants will provide a safe haven for life to flourish. You’ll also be mitigating soil loss, reducing runoff, and lowering your fossil fuel footprint.

              We give our plants multivitamins. Sort of. Did you know that adding trace minerals into the soil provides plants with all of the micro-nutrients they need to create a plethora of vitamins, minerals, and best of all, those glorious aromatic flavor compounds? Supermarket produce doesn’t come close in terms of nutrient density, even their fancy “organic” stuff.

              Fact: Nature is mind-blowingly gorgeous. It also provides an amazing getaway from the stress and anxiety that can get the best of us all. Time and time again, science has shown the multitude of benefits of spending time in nature. (The nerd-word is “biophilia.”) Even a small space can yield plenty of joy. And many of the species we plant are show-stoppers in the looks department.

              We believe that the ability to provide you and your loved ones with an essential human need is a pretty important life skill. We’ll get back to you when we figure out how to produce air and water ourselves (right after giving our Nobel acceptance speech). In the meantime, let us give you a kick start on your way to more liberty and less reliance on corporations and industrialized agriculture. We encourage everyone to become a more self-sufficient member of society and this planet
