                  We give our plants multi-vitamins. Sort of. Did you know that adding trace minerals into the soil provides plants with all of the micro-nutrients they need to create a plethora of vitamins, minerals, and best of all, those glorious aromatic flavor compounds. Supermarket produce doesn’t come close in terms of nutrient density, even the fancy “organic” stuff.

                  Buzzkill: The leading cause of biodiversity loss is habitat destruction and degradation. In addition to providing produce to you, our landscapes aim to create habitat and forage for birds, pollinators, and other beneficial critters. Your plants will provide a safe haven for life to flourish. You’ll also be mitigating soil loss, reducing runoff, and lowering your fossil fuel footprint.
