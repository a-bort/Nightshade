            <h3>The Backstory</h3>
            <p>Yo! We are Bort and Caleb...and we’re excited that you’re checking out this project. At one point along this path, we were both simply concerned about getting easier access to fresh herbs to cook with. Immediately, we noticed the bump in flavor and freshness in our homegrown herbs. We also began to realize that growing your own herbs also has other perks: convenience, less waste, and saving some serious dough at the grocery store (especially if you already opt for organic). </p>
            <p>We also found fulfillment in learning how to keep plants alive...err...how to cultivate our own personalized collection of fine herbs! We found a creative outlet in selecting plants that complemented our favorite cooking styles and cocktail recipes. It evokes a honest sense of pride and badassery when you walk out your back door, snip off a couple sprigs of flat-leaf parsley, and use that astounding aroma and flavor to bring out the highest potential in your own inspired culinary creation. We are home cooks, cocktail enthusiasts, DC denizens, and big fans of living the Good Life…join us on that journey!</p>

            <h3>Bort</h3>
            <p>It started as most great adventures do - with a stiff drink. A "South Side", to be specific. You see, when I set out to refine my cocktail crafting capabilities, I quickly realized two things. First, drinks made with fresh herbs are generally incredible. Second, it's annoying and highly inefficient to buy those herbs at the store. The solution was obvious, and what started as a few plants on a window sill has grown into a full-fledged passion project.</p>
            <p>I love building things and I love sharing my interests with others. Be it a piece of software or a plant installation, I find immense joy in taking a concept and shaping it into a reality. I believe life is short, and it should be spent eating the best food, drinking the best drinks, and generally enjoying the best that this green earth has to offer.</p>

            <h3>Caleb</h3>
            <p>Caleb’s favorite acid? Cider vinegar. Favorite spice? Trick question! I have two: cumin and cinnamon. Whipping up healthy and (usually) delicious food is somewhat of an obsession of mine...Sunday night is salad prep night...feta and pistachios are my lifeblood. I’m a decent singer, a wretched guitarist, and I LOVE heavy metal (among other flavors of music).</p>
            <p>Along that same vein, I love to cook with aggressive flavors and assert that every dish should include a healthy pinch of cayenne. I love to explore the worlds of craft beer and cocktails (fan of floral gin, sweet vermouths, and anisettes). I moonlight as a full-time ecologist, tromping around wetlands, forests, and the occasional cubicle. I’m a huge nature nerd and animal lover, and I try my best to walk the walk in terms of sustainable living \m/</p>
